### **Data Integrity Testing**

We combine **data engineering tools** and **QA principles** to ensure every record in your Snowflake instance is trustworthy.

* Automated **dbt tests** for schema, nulls, duplicates, and constraints
* Validation across **transformation layers** and staging environments
* End-to-end test coverage — ingestion → transformation → visualization
* Continuous monitoring and alerting for **data drift and anomalies**


### **Our Approach**

| Step               | Focus                                    | Tools & Methods                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **1. Assess**      | Environment and data pipeline review     | Snowflake Worksheets, dbt, SnowSQL |
| **2. Automate**    | Embed repeatable data quality checks     | dbt tests, Python Connector        |
| **3. Validate**    | Confirm data accuracy and access control | SQL assertions, access audits      |
