What security measures ensure that SafeGen remains a user-friendly solution while maintaining compliance with privacy standards?,"['<1-hop>\n\nGenerated on 10/03/2025 The solution demonstrates ease of use as follows: SafeGen is designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly age assurance system that is both eﬀective and accessible for parents, children, and veriﬁed adults. The system ensures compliance with regulatory requirements while remaining simple to use, minimizing disruption to legitimate users, and eﬀectively preventing underage access to restricted content. By prioritizing ease of use, SafeGen oﬀers a practical solution that integrates eﬀortlessly into existing digital environments. For parents, SafeGen oﬀers a straightforward and eﬃcient registration process. In less than two minutes, they can register their mobile number and blacklist a child’s phone number, all through a fully phone-based system that eliminates the need for complex account setup or document uploads. The process relies on familiar SMS-based authentication using one-time passcodes, making it accessible to parents regardless of their level of technical expertise. Because the system requires the parent to have physical possession of the child’s device for veriﬁcation, it provides an additional layer of security while remaining easy to implement. Unlike other veriﬁcation methods that involve passwords, biometric scans, or cumbersome veriﬁcation steps, SafeGen ensures that parents can control their child’s digital access with minimal eﬀort. Once the system is in place, parents receive real-time notiﬁcations if their child attempts to access restricted content and can manage blacklisted numbers through a simple, intuitive interface. Children experience no additional burdens when using SafeGen, as the entire veriﬁcation process is managed by their parents. Unlike AI-based age veriﬁcation systems or document-based veriﬁcation, which often require children to upload images, submit identity documents, or engage with age estimation tools, SafeGen operates passively in the background. This allows it to enforce access restrictions without disrupting a child’s digital experience. When a blacklisted child attempts to access a restricted service, they receive a clear and non-confusing message explaining that access has been blocked due to parental controls. This approach ensures that younger users understand why they are restricted without encountering complex or technical explanations. Importantly, SafeGen does not interfere with children’s access to age-appropriate services. The system speciﬁcally targets age-restricted platforms, such as social media and adult content sites, while allowing children to continue using educational tools, entertainment apps, and other digital services without requiring additional veriﬁcation steps. For veriﬁed adults, SafeGen oﬀers a simple and eﬃcient way to access age-restricted content without repeated veriﬁcation. Adults seeking access to platforms such as gambling sites, adult content, or alcohol-related purchases need to verify their phone number only once using SMS-based authentication. After veriﬁcation, SafeGen issues a cryptographically secure token that allows seamless future access without requiring users to re-enter credentials. Unlike traditional age veriﬁcation solutions that demand identity documents, such as driver’s licenses or passports, or require facial scans, SafeGen’s system is designed to be fast, non-intrusive, and privacy-preserving. To ensure that children do not exploit the system, the veriﬁcation token is automatically revalidated periodically, preventing unauthorized access while maintaining a frictionless experience for legitimate adult users. For online platforms and service providers, SafeGen introduces no extra burdens or operational complexities. The system integrates eﬀortlessly via a lightweight API that enables real-time blacklist veriﬁcation, eliminating the need for complex machine learning models, external identity databases, or manual moderation processes. SafeGen’s automated decision-making process ensures that access control is both simple and eﬃcient. If a phone number appears on the blacklist, access is denied automatically; if a number is not blacklisted, access is granted without requiring additional steps. Unlike traditional veriﬁcation systems that demand continuous monitoring and manual approvals, SafeGen functions independently once integrated, allowing platforms to enforce age restrictions seamlessly and with minimal administrative eﬀort. By leveraging familiar mobile authentication methods, eliminating unnecessary veriﬁcation steps, and ensuring minimal disruption for legitimate users, SafeGen provides a highly accessible and eﬃcient age assurance system. Parents can manage their children’s digital access with ease, children face no undue obstacles in using appropriate services, veriﬁed adults beneﬁt from a streamlined veriﬁcation process, and platforms can implement SafeGen with minimal', '<2-hop>\n\neﬀort. This approach ensures that SafeGen remains an eﬀective, privacy-preserving, and user-friendly solution for online age veriﬁcation while maintaining high security and regulatory compliance. Security measures applied to the solution are as follows:']","SafeGen remains an effective, privacy-preserving, and user-friendly solution for online age verification while maintaining high security and regulatory compliance through various security measures. These measures include the use of SMS-based authentication for verifying phone numbers, which ensures that only verified adults can access age-restricted content. Additionally, the system issues a cryptographically secure token after initial verification, allowing seamless future access without repeated credential entry. To prevent unauthorized access, the verification token is automatically revalidated periodically.

How does the ISO 27566-1 Practice Statement ensure compliance with privacy laws while implementing age assurance methods?,"['<1-hop>\n\nISO 27566-1 Practice Statement\nSolution Owner: Eden Game Development Centre\nEden Game Development Centre is a(n) Age Assurance Provider (an entity responsible for providing age assurance\nresults to a relying party)\nThis is a practice statement for the age assurance solution known as Veriﬁed Accounts\nThe system and practice statement are kept under continuous and regular review in the following way:\nWith key components being developed and tested as part of our governance approach, we are establishing a\nframework for continuous and structured review, including oversight by senior management. This will ensure that the\nsystem evolves in alignment with regulatory requirements, privacy and security standards, and emerging best\npractices.\nTop management will play a central role in reviewing performance data, audit ﬁndings, and user feedback at regular\nintervals. These reviews will guide improvements and ensure the system remains eﬀective, transparent, and\nresponsive as it moves toward full deployment.\nThis solution is designed to test the following age eligibility requirements:\nAge eligibility is determined through veriﬁcation of oﬃcial documentation provided by the user, which is automatically\ncross referenced with authoritative government databases. This ensures a clear and objective determination of\nwhether the individual meets the required age threshold. There is no ambiguity in age assessment, as it relies solely\non factual data derived from oﬃcial sources. The age requirement criteria are established by the relevant\npolicymakers, service providers, or regulatory authorities, and our system complies with those mandates. Any\nintermediaries involved in processing or validating this information are vetted and operate under strict accountability\nprotocols.\nThis solution utilizes the following Age assurance components:\nThe system uses a two-step age assurance process. First, the user submits identity and age documentation, which is\nautomatically compared against government records to conﬁrm its authenticity and accuracy. This veriﬁcation step is\nstrictly based on primary credentials such as birth certiﬁcates or passports. No age estimation, inference, or\nbehavioral analysis is used at any point. Second, a live video call is scheduled with a trained veriﬁer to conﬁrm that\nthe individual presenting the documents matches the provided information. This ﬁnal conﬁrmation links the individual\nto the veriﬁed account, ensuring a high level of conﬁdence in the result.\nThis solution delivers results to meet the following Indicators of conﬁdence:\nWe aim to achieve 80% age assurance conﬁdence for 20% of the eﬀort. The initial document and data veriﬁcation\nagainst government databases ensures that the information provided is 100% genuine. The follow-up video\nveriﬁcation adds an additional layer of assurance by conﬁrming the person’s identity visually and interactively. This\nprocess creates a level of certainty equivalent to setting up a bank account or obtaining a driver’s license in person.\nIt is not technically feasible to guarantee that the veriﬁed user is the only person using the account at all times,\nattempts to enforce such a standard would require excessive intrusiveness and would not be proportionate to the\nlegal, privacy and human rights considerations involved.\nExponential costs for marginal gains.', '<2-hop>\n\nGenerated on 17/05/2025\nThe solution applies the following Binding process:\nThe binding of the age assurance result to the subject is managed either through anonymised persistent identiﬁers or\npseudonymised session tokens, depending on service conﬁguration.\nFor services requiring a durable user context, we utilise unique, anonymised account identiﬁers, scoped to each\nrelying party. These identiﬁers are generated and stored in a manner that prevents re-identiﬁcation and contain no\nPII. They allow the age assurance result to be persistently associated with the correct subject, while remaining\nunlinkable outside the scope of the speciﬁc service.\nFor session-only implementations, the age assurance result is associated with a temporary, pseudonymised session\ntoken, which is discarded at the end of the session lifecycle. No persistent user records are retained by the age\nassurance provider.\nAll bindings are protected using cryptographically secure mechanisms to prevent tampering, misuse, or unauthorised\nreuse. This approach supports privacy-by-design principles and aligns with international best practice, including\nISO/IEC 27566 and ISO/IEC 29100 requirements for data minimisation, unlinkability, and integrity of personal data\nprocessing.\n The solution achieves Privacy and data protection as follows:\nAgeChecked operates under the principles of the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018, and takes into account the\nrequirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR), relevant US privacy laws including the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the Australian Privacy\nAct 1988, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and Argentina’s Ley de\nProtección de los Datos Personales (Law No. 25.326). Our systems are designed to uphold the highest standards of\nprivacy across jurisdictions, with a strong emphasis on data minimisation, transparency, and user rights.\n Data minimisation: Only the minimal information necessary for assurance is collected—typically a date of birth or\npseudonymous token. No biometric data or government-issued ID is stored by default.\n Purpose limitation: Data is processed solely for the purpose of age assurance and is not reused for unrelated\ncommercial proﬁling or behavioural targeting.\n Transparency and control: Users are informed of what data is processed and for what purpose via our public privacy\npolicy. Users can exercise their rights to access, rectify, or erase their data through a clearly deﬁned DPO contact\nchannel.\n']","The ISO 27566-1 Practice Statement ensures compliance with privacy laws while implementing age assurance methods by establishing a framework for continuous review and oversight by senior management.

How does Veridas' age assurance system ensure compliance with NIST standards while protecting user privacy?,"['<1-hop>\n\nGenerated on 18/03/2025\nSecurity measures applied to the solution are as follows:\nVeridas has designed its age assurance system to fully align with the security characteristics outlined in the AATT\nD-2.9 Evaluation Proposal Report. By integrating cutting-edge biometric security, rigorous data protection measures,\nand industry-leading fraud prevention mechanisms, Veridas delivers a robust, privacy-compliant, and highly secure\nsolution for verifying user age.\n1.  Privacy Protection: Data Minimization & Zero-Storage Principle\nVeridas adheres to strict global data protection regulations, including GDPR (Europe), BIPA (U.S.), Australian Law and\nother local regulations, ensuring that users’ personal information is handled with the highest standards of\nconﬁdentiality. Veridas follows a Zero-Data policy, meaning it does not store biometric templates or personally\nidentiﬁable information (PII) beyond the duration of the veriﬁcation process. Veridas’ Age Veriﬁcation system provides\na binary age eligibility indicator, signiﬁcantly reducing the risk of data misuse or breaches. This approach guarantees\nuser anonymity while ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks\u200b.\n2.  Data Security: Advanced Encryption & Access Controls\nTo protect sensitive information, Veridas implements end-to-end encryption (AES-GLS-256) for both stored and\ntransmitted data. The system is fortiﬁed with API authentication, request throttling, and rate limiting, ensuring that\nonly authorized entities can access the veriﬁcation service. Additionally, Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection\nand real-time intrusion monitoring further safeguard the system against external threats\u200b.\n3.  Fraud Prevention & Non-Repudiation\nVeridas sets the gold standard in fraud prevention through iBeta Level 1 & 2-certiﬁed liveness detection, which\neﬀectively blocks deepfake, mask, and replay attacks. The system integrates presentation attack detection (PAD) and\ninjection attack prevention mechanisms, making it virtually impossible for false identities to bypass the veriﬁcation\nprocess. By implementing non-repudiation mechanisms, every authentication attempt is cryptographically recorded,\nensuring that identity veriﬁcation results are tamper-proof and legally defensible\u200b.\n4.  Accuracy & Reliability: Unmatched Biometric Performance\nVeridas’ age estimation AI is recognized for its industry-leading precision, boasting a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of\njust 1.55 years. The system achieves 0% false classiﬁcation of minors -as certiﬁed by ACCS and ACCS testing\nparameters (see certiﬁcate in this link)- providing exceptional reliability in preventing underage access to age-\nrestricted services. Additionally, Veridas’ facial recognition engine ranks among the top in NIST evaluations for 1:1,\nand got ranked as #2 in 1:N biometric matching (for 1 against 12 million identities test), ensuring high accuracy and\nspeed across all veriﬁcation processes\u200b.\n5.', '<2-hop>\n\nThe solution protects human rights in the following ways:\nThe age assurance service is primarily available to relying parties who have access to legitimate, objective, fact based\ndata across a broad range of data sources. The breadth of this range promotes inclusivity for an age assurance\nprocess covering the majority of the Australian population.\nIn addition, Equifax AgeID leverages facial biometrics capabilities which have been certiﬁed by a NIST accredited\ntesting lab as having no evidence of bias. The solution also uses its own AI synthetic generator that continuously\nupdates veriﬁcation engines if any bias is detected.\nThe user identity veriﬁcation ﬂow has also been designed so that it is simple to use with meaningful visual and verbal\nprompts built into the ﬂow to assist with document and face capture.\nThe solution has been subject to audit, certiﬁcation and review in the following ways:\nEquifax’s business in Australia involves the handling of data, including personal information (including credit\ninformation) and government-sourced data. As such, Equifax, is subject to routine oversight, queries, audit and other\nreview by agencies, authorities and regulators, including the OAIC, ASIC, the ACCC, AFCA, Attorney General’s\nDepartment and government data licensing agencies. Additionally, third-party data sources, such as the\nSuperannuation and Payroll provider, maintain their own audit rights as an added layer of oversight.\nAs a credit reporting body, Equifax is subject to the Privacy Act (including the Australian Privacy Principles and the\nCredit Reporting Code), the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, and the AML/CTF Act.\nCompliance with these Acts necessitates the establishment of robust internal frameworks and controls for regular\nreview. This includes audits of data handling practices, credit reporting processes conducted by internal audit teams.\nFindings and recommendations are reported to the risk and compliance teams and senior management to ensure\ntimely remediation and the ongoing eﬀectiveness. In addition, updates are made to policies, procedures, and systems\nto reﬂect any regulatory changes to ensure a culture of compliance and continuous improvement.\nEquifax follows industry best practices and Equifax Australia has achieved SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certiﬁcations for our\ncore products and environment.

How does k-ID ensure compliance with age assurance principles while protecting the privacy of Digital Minors and what specific data is collected from trusted adults?,"['<1-hop>\n\nAlignment with EDPB’s Statement 1/2025 on Age Assurance\nThe EDPB has established ten principles for the compliant processing of personal data in age assurance, emphasizing\nthe protection of minors and adherence to data protection principles. k-ID applies these even in the context of the\nEngine and the Family Tools. As our platform uses age signals in order to deliver compliance and family management\nit is incredibly important that we implement the same principles as set out in the EDPB Statement throughout the\nentire stack. This includes the following:\n– Purpose Limitation: Data provided by users for age assurance is not stored by k-ID and is used solely for age\nassurance. This ensures that data collected for age assurance is not repurposed for other activities, maintaining\ncompliance with GDPR and applicable data protection principles. k-ID ensures that processing of any such data is\nstrictly limited to age assurance, without any secondary use. Further, as explained above, k-ID applies a proprietary\nprivacy-preserving taxonomy across our entire system architecture, to ensure that data is transmitted in a way that\npreserves privacy while facilitating an actionable result (e.g., once you know a user is a Digital Minor, knowing\nspeciﬁcally how old they are does not gain anything for the relying party, they just need to know how to adapt their\nfeatures and processing activities, including how to enable a trusted adult to manage that child’s experience).\n– Storage Restrictions: k-ID does not store any information that users provide for age assurance purposes. k-ID only\nstores the age assurance results for auditability purposes. This approach minimizes data retention, reducing the risk\nof unauthorized access or breaches. k-ID’s data retention policies are designed to ensure that data is not stored\nlonger than necessary, as disclosed in k-ID’s Privacy Policy. As noted above, for the Engine no personal information is\nstored, and for the Family Tools the trusted adult is in full control over the conﬁguration and information they provide\nand retain in their account.\n– User Control: As no data that users provided for age assurance is retained by k-ID, users can have complete control\nover their data. For the purposes of k-ID’s Family Tools, data subject rights management is fully self-serve.\nAdditionally, insofar as the trusted adult seeks to modify permissions as it relates to their child’s data processing, to', '<2-hop>\n\nGenerated on 14/03/2025\nthat we do not collect personal information from children. We process only two identiﬁers with respect to a child: their\ndate of birth or age, along with a nickname. Both of these are provided or validated by the parent. We have worked\nexceptionally hard to deliver a compliance service focused on children that actually does not collect personal\ninformation from children.\n– Limited personal identiﬁer is collected from trusted adults: We only process the email address of a parent for the\npurpose of them setting up and managing their account. We do not process other personal identiﬁers (name, address,\ncredit card information, advertising identiﬁers, etc.). We do not use any personal identiﬁer to advertise to the parents.\nWe have again deliberately designed the system to be extremely powerful while extremely data-lite.\n–  Our Engine uses a powerful privacy-preserving taxonomy we built from the ground up: We speciﬁcally designed our\nAPIs to minimize the need for personal information. That is why when we return a result to a relying party as to how to\nadjust the experience for the end user (e.g., turn chat oﬀ, disable targeted advertising, etc.) we do not share age.\nInstead, we share a user classiﬁcation (Digital Minor, Digital Youth, or Adult). This taxonomy is aligned to the legal\ncompliance requirements as to digital consent and age of majority in the relevant jurisdiction (both country level and\nstate level). This means the end user is provided with a compliant and age-adapted experience, while no personal\ninformation is transferred to the relying party whose features are being adapted. In practice, this means that any\nplatform (relying party) can deliver a fully compliant experience, that is based on an age veriﬁed or assured using one\nof our partners, without ever needing to actually process personal information.\n–  Information shared by age assurance providers with k-ID: k-ID does not receive any credit card, ID or other personal\ninformation relating to any veriﬁcation checks. k-ID only retains a record of the date/time stamp that the check has\nbeen conducted, and the method adopted (i.e., which provider was used).\n–  A trusted adult retains full control over their child’s information: A trusted adult can revoke consent or delete their\nchild’s conﬁguration at any time. We even include a special button that allows a trusted adult to instantly submit a\ndata subject request, in compliance with the Privacy Act 1988, directly to the relying party. This submission can be\nmade directly through our Family Tools, meaning the relying party never has to ask the trusted adult for a passport,\nID or other identifying information.\nb. ']","k-ID ensures compliance with age assurance principles by adhering to the EDPB’s Statement 1/2025, which emphasizes the protection of minors and the importance of purpose limitation, storage restrictions, and user control. Specifically, k-ID does not store any personal information provided for age assurance; it only retains the age assurance results for auditability. For Digital Minors, k-ID processes only two identifiers: their date of birth or age, and a nickname, both validated by a parent. Regarding trusted adults, k-ID only collects their email address for account management purposes, ensuring that no other personal identifiers are processed.

Our Engine and Family Tools deliver the\nfollowing:\nReliability: k-ID applies a compliance conﬁguration to an end user via the Engine. This ensures that the result from the\nage assurance provider is not simply a pass / fail, or an age or age range, but rather the actual information that the\nrelying party needs in order to make an age-related eligibility decision and/or to adjust the experience of the user\n(e.g., for chat). k-ID leverages mechanisms such as encryption to prevent tampering, including in the webhooks that\nlink to the age assurance provider. The Engine is conﬁgured by the relying party, is subject to monthly regulatory\ncompliance updates, and is updated for the user every time a new session is pulled from the API (ensuring that the\nlatest policy engine is applied to the user). Similarly, the same approach is applied to the Family Tools, to ensure that\npermissions modiﬁed by a trusted adult are delivered through the Engine each time a session commences.\nFairness: Our Engine and Family Tools are entirely end user agnostic. The Engine is aligned to the legal compliance\nrequirements in each jurisdiction and are modiﬁed by the relying party. The Family Tools support multiple languages.\nOur Engine supports multiple age veriﬁcation and assurance methods (e.g., facial age estimation, ID checks, credit\ncard veriﬁcation), to facilitate greater access for end users to appropriate veriﬁcation.\nTransparency: Provides clear, multilingual explanations to users about data processing, both in the developer portal\nfor the Engine and in the Family Tools. Users are informed about how their data is used, stored, and shared, and its\nimplications. These explanations are included in k-ID’s Privacy Policy (available at:\nhttps://www.k-id.com/privacy-policy). In addition, k-ID has established a dedicated Family Support Center (available\nat: https://k-id.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) which addresses frequently asked questions by the parents and children.\nPrivacy: k-ID’s Engine and Family Tools are designed to be the best example of Privacy by Design and Default. Both\nthe Engine and Family Tools are speciﬁcally designed to minimize processing of personal information. k-ID only\ncollects and retains data that is absolutely necessary to deliver the service, in compliance with Australia's Privacy Act\n1988. To name several speciﬁc examples:\n– as our Engine interprets the age delivered by an age assurance vendor and determines what features to turn oﬀ and\non, as well as what a parent needs to approve, if a relying party so chooses then we actually don’t need to\ncommunicate the age of the user at all – delivering a compliant and safe experience without the need for the relying\nparty to actually process the personal information of the end user (we can instead communicate that the user is a\n“Digital Minor” or “Digital Youth” based on local regulatory age classiﬁcation for digital consent);\n– our Family Tools do not process any personal information collected from a child except where it is expressly\nvalidated by a trusted adult, to ensure there is a high degree of certainty that a trusted adult has provided consent;\n– our Family Tools include a customer support and DSAR module, to enable a trusted adult to make requests to the\nrelying party on behalf of their child. However, whereas usually a trusted adult needs to provide passport or identity\ninformation to validate who they are (to a relying party), k-ID has already conﬁrmed that veriﬁcation and the trusted\nadult makes the request directly from our Family Tools, meaning the relying party does not need to ask for any further\npersonal information.\nb.
