How does the EU General Data Protection Regulation influence the binding process for age assurance results?,"['Generated on 17/05/2025\nThe solution applies the following Binding process:\nThe binding of the age assurance result to the subject is managed either through anonymised persistent identiﬁers or\npseudonymised session tokens, depending on service conﬁguration.\nFor services requiring a durable user context, we utilise unique, anonymised account identiﬁers, scoped to each\nrelying party. These identiﬁers are generated and stored in a manner that prevents re-identiﬁcation and contain no\nPII. They allow the age assurance result to be persistently associated with the correct subject, while remaining\nunlinkable outside the scope of the speciﬁc service.\nFor session-only implementations, the age assurance result is associated with a temporary, pseudonymised session\ntoken, which is discarded at the end of the session lifecycle. No persistent user records are retained by the age\nassurance provider.\nAll bindings are protected using cryptographically secure mechanisms to prevent tampering, misuse, or unauthorised\nreuse. This approach supports privacy-by-design principles and aligns with international best practice, including\nISO/IEC 27566 and ISO/IEC 29100 requirements for data minimisation, unlinkability, and integrity of personal data\nprocessing.\n The solution achieves Privacy and data protection as follows:\nAgeChecked operates under the principles of the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018, and takes into account the\nrequirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR), relevant US privacy laws including the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the Australian Privacy\nAct 1988, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and Argentina’s Ley de\nProtección de los Datos Personales (Law No. 25.326). Our systems are designed to uphold the highest standards of\nprivacy across jurisdictions, with a strong emphasis on data minimisation, transparency, and user rights.\n Data minimisation: Only the minimal information necessary for assurance is collected—typically a date of birth or\npseudonymous token. No biometric data or government-issued ID is stored by default.\n Purpose limitation: Data is processed solely for the purpose of age assurance and is not reused for unrelated\ncommercial proﬁling or behavioural targeting.\n Transparency and control: Users are informed of what data is processed and for what purpose via our public privacy\npolicy. Users can exercise their rights to access, rectify, or erase their data through a clearly deﬁned DPO contact\nchannel.\n']","The EU General Data Protection Regulation influences the binding process for age assurance results by ensuring that the binding is managed through anonymised persistent identifiers or pseudonymised session tokens, which prevents re-identification and contains no personally identifiable information (PII).

How does the Age Check Certification Scheme ensure compliance and reliability in age assurance systems?,"[""Generated on 28/02/2025\n The solution protects human rights in the following ways:\nOur age assurance system is built on a foundation of robust security, ethical data practices, and accessible design.\nOur lightweight, compiled C++ shareable object—integrated seamlessly with WASM, Swift, Kotlin, and\nPython—ensures that all biometric processing occurs securely on the user’s device, eliminating data exposure risks.\nOur machine learning models are trained exclusively on 100% ethically sourced data, which includes real, consented\nimages alongside synthetic image sets. This approach not only guarantees accuracy and fairness but also upholds\nhigh ethical standards in data collection and usage.\nAccessibility and inclusion are central to our design. The user interface features intuitive graphics and imagery that\nare easily understood by users of all ages. Real-time user guidance provides clear, step-by-step instructions\nthroughout the veriﬁcation process, ensuring that both children and adults can navigate the UI/UX eﬀortlessly. This\ndesign minimizes barriers and prevents undue restriction of access to essential services such as news, health, and\neducation.\nIn summary, our age assurance solution combines secure on-device processing, ethically trained machine learning\nmodels, and a user-friendly, accessible interface to provide a reliable and inclusive age veriﬁcation experience for all\nusers to protect human rights.\nThe solution has been subject to audit, certiﬁcation and review in the following ways:\nOur age assurance system is rigorously monitored and evaluated through continuous internal and customer-led\nauditing, as well as independent third-party certiﬁcation. We perform ongoing audits that assess performance,\nsecurity, and bias, ensuring that our solution consistently meets the highest performance standards with the lowest\nMAE in the industry. In parallel, our customers conduct their own audits to conﬁrm our system's reliable performance\nand to rigorously monitor for bias to ensure consistent outcomes.\nAdditionally, our technology is independently tested and certiﬁed under the Age Check Certiﬁcation Scheme (ACCS),\nwhere we have achieved EAL 3 certiﬁcation.\nThe PrivateID ML team is also dedicated to continually enhancing our models' performance.\nThis comprehensive approach—encompassing continuous internal and external audits along with third-party\ncertiﬁcation—ensures that our age assurance system maintains the highest accuracy, speed and unbiased decisioning\nwhile maintaining complete user privacy.\n""]","The Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS) ensures compliance and reliability in age assurance systems through rigorous monitoring and evaluation, including continuous internal and customer-led auditing, as well as independent third-party certification.
